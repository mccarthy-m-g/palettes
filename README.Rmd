palettes is an R package for working with colour palettes. The goal of palettes is to provide methods for working with colour palettes, particularly for developers who want to make their own colour palette package. It is in very early development.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) with:

```r
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mccarthy-m-g/palettes")

# Install from R-universe
install.packages('palettes', repos = 'https://mccarthy-m-g.r-universe.dev')
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(palettes)
```

Colours can be specified by name (as listed by `grDevices::colours()`):

```{asciicast pal-colour-character}
pal_colour("red")
```

Or by hex code:

```{asciicast pal-colour-hex}
pal_colour("#FF0000")
```

Multiple colours can be specified at once as a character vector:

```{asciicast pal-colour-vector}
pal_colour(c("#FF0000", "blue", "green"))
```

Named colour palettes can be specified in the same way:

```{asciicast pal-palette}
pal_palette(
  palette_1 = c("#FF0000", "blue", "green"),
  palette_2 = c(c("yellow", "orange", "purple"))
)
```

Colours also work in tibbles:

```{asciicast tibble}
tibble(
  colours = pal_colour(c("#FF0000", "blue", "green"))
)
```

## Documentation

See at [`https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/palettes/`](https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/palettes/reference/index.html) and also in the installed package: `help(package = "palettes")`.
