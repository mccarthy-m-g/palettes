palettes is an R package for working with colour vectors and colour palettes. There are three main goals to the palettes package, each described in a vignette:

- To provide a new family of colour classes (`palettes_colour` and `palettes_palette`) that always print as hex codes with colour previews; `vignette("palettes")`.

- To provide a comprehensive library of methods for working with colour vectors and colour palettes, including methods for ggplot2, `vignette("ggplot2")`; gt, `vignette("gt")`; biscale, `vignette("biscale")`; and other colour packages, `vignette("compatibility")`.

- To make it easy for anyone to make their own colour palette package; `vignette("creating-packages")`. Colour palette packages made with palettes exist solely for the purpose of distributing colour palettes and get access to all the features of palettes for free.

## Installation

Install palettes from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("palettes")
```

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) with:

```r
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mccarthy-m-g/palettes")

# Install from R-universe
install.packages('palettes', repos = 'https://mccarthy-m-g.r-universe.dev')
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(palettes)
```

Colours can be specified by name (as listed by `grDevices::colours()`):

```{asciicast pal-colour-character}
pal_colour("red")
```

Or by hex code:

```{asciicast pal-colour-hex}
pal_colour("#FF0000")
```

Multiple colours can be specified at once as a character vector:

```{asciicast pal-colour-vector}
pal_colour(c("#a00e00", "#d04e00", "#f6c200", "#0086a8", "#132b69"))
```

Named colour palettes can be specified in the same way:

```{asciicast pal-palette}
pal_palette(
  egypt = c("#dd5129", "#0f7ba2", "#43b284", "#fab255"),
  java  = c("#663171", "#cf3a36", "#ea7428", "#e2998a", "#0c7156")
)
```

Colours also print nicely in tibbles:

```{asciicast tibble}
as_tibble(pal_colour(c("#dd5129", "#0f7ba2", "#43b284", "#fab255")))
```
